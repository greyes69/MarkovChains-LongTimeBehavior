Given a finite Markov Chain, this code simulates the dynamics starting from any given state for any given number of time steps. The simulation is repeated as many times as given. The output includes the 
evolution for some of the experiments and the proportion of final states. If the transition matrix is regular, the limit distribution is the stationary one, given by the eigenvector with eigenvalue =1.
